Are Gamers Streaming
====================

This is a program I wrote to gain more experience with WPF. 
As well test out the MVPVM pattern.

It's purpose is to just notify users when certain people on twitch.tv are streaming.
I am hoping to keep working on this project.

Future features 
---------------

A way to view streams outside of web browser via vlc or media player.
Add a way for recording streams.

For right now it is just a small project to get my feet wet.
